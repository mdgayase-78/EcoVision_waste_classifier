Project Problem Statement 
The world is facing increasing environmental degradation due to unsustainable 
consumption of resources, pollution, and waste generation. Rapid urbanization, 
industrialization, and population growth have led to excessive use of energy, 
water, and raw materials, threatening the balance of ecosystems. There is an 
urgent need for sustainable solutions that promote responsible resource use, 
renewable energy adoption, and eco-friendly technologies to ensure 
environmental, social, and economic well-being for future generations. 
Project Problem Statement 
To address this issue, there is a need for an intelligent, automated system that can 
accurately classify waste using advanced technologies like Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs). Such a system can promote sustainable waste management, 
support recycling initiatives, and reduce the environmental impact caused by 
improper disposal practices.
